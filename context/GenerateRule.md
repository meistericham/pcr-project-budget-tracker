# Generate Rule

- Read PRD.md and create/update:
  - ImplementationPlan.md (tasks + subtasks)
  - ProjectStructure.md (mirror current folders/files)
  - UI_UX.md (wireframes in text + behavior)
  - BugTracking.md (log new issues you find)
- Keep WorkflowRule.md short; always leave it in context.
- Do not invent endpoints or tables beyond PRD.
- When editing code, include exact file paths and unified diffs.
