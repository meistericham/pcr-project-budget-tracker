# Bug / Issue Log

## Bug Fix: Super Admin Authorization Check Priority (2024-12-19)
- **Title**: Fix Super Admin authorization check to prioritize JWT role as source of truth
- **Summary**: 
  - Updated useIsSuperAdmin hook to trust JWT role (supabase.auth.getSession) as primary source
  - Only falls back to users table lookup when JWT role is missing
  - Improves performance and security by prioritizing JWT claims
  - Maintains backward compatibility with database fallback

- **Problem Summary**: 
  - Previous implementation mixed JWT and database role checking without clear priority
  - Could lead to inconsistent authorization decisions
  - Database queries were always executed even when JWT had sufficient information
  - No clear source of truth for role determination

- **Root Cause**: 
  - useIsSuperAdmin hook was checking both JWT and database without clear priority
  - Mixed approach could lead to race conditions or inconsistent results
  - Database fallback was always executed regardless of JWT role validity

- **Changes Made**:
  - File: `src/lib/authz.ts` — updated useIsSuperAdmin hook
    - **Primary**: JWT role from `session?.user?.app_metadata?.role` is now source of truth
    - **Immediate Trust**: If JWT says 'super_admin', return true immediately without database query
    - **Fallback Only**: Database lookup only happens when JWT role is missing or not 'super_admin'
    - **Performance**: Eliminates unnecessary database queries for JWT super_admin users
    - **Security**: JWT claims are trusted as primary authorization source

- **Bugs found & fixed**:
  - ✅ Inconsistent role checking priority (JWT now primary, database fallback)
  - ✅ Unnecessary database queries for JWT super_admin users (eliminated)
  - ✅ Mixed authorization sources without clear hierarchy (clarified)

- **Verification steps**:
  1. Super Admin with JWT role 'super_admin' → immediate authorization (no DB query)
  2. User with missing JWT role → falls back to database lookup
  3. User with JWT role 'admin' → falls back to database lookup
  4. Auth state changes trigger proper re-checking
  5. Build and TypeScript check pass

- **Technical Implementation Details**:
  - JWT role check: `session?.user?.app_metadata?.role`
  - Immediate return for JWT super_admin: `if (jwtRole === 'super_admin') return true`
  - Database fallback only when JWT insufficient
  - Proper cleanup with alive flag to prevent memory leaks
  - Auth state change listeners for real-time updates

- **Date**: 2024-12-19
- **Commit**: fix(authz): prioritize JWT role as source of truth, database as fallback only

## Bug Fix: /admin/users Page Button Functionality (2024-12-19)
- **Title**: Fix /admin/users page so all action buttons reliably open dialogs and perform actions
- **Summary**: 
  - Fixed missing "Assign Now" and "Edit user" buttons on /admin/users page
  - Resolved button click issues that prevented dialogs from opening
  - Hardened Super-Admin gating to be more robust and avoid race conditions
  - Added proper z-index management to prevent overlay issues
  - Integrated UserModal for user editing and assignment functionality

- **Problem Summary**: 
  - /admin/users page was missing "Assign Now" and "Edit user" buttons
  - Existing buttons had click issues preventing dialogs from opening
  - Super-Admin gating had race conditions and used wrong table ('profiles' instead of 'users')
  - Missing modal integration for user management actions
  - Potential z-index issues causing overlay problems

- **Root Cause**: 
  - Incomplete implementation of UsersAdmin.tsx - only had password reset functionality
  - useIsSuperAdmin hook reading from 'profiles' table instead of 'users' table
  - Missing UserModal integration for user editing and assignment
  - Race conditions in auth state checking
  - No proper z-index management for table and modal layers

- **Changes Made**:
  - File: `src/lib/authz.ts` — hardened useIsSuperAdmin hook
    - Added JWT metadata fallback for faster role checking
    - Changed from 'profiles' to 'users' table for role lookup
    - Added proper race condition handling with alive flag
    - Improved error handling and logging
  - File: `src/pages/UsersAdmin.tsx` — complete functionality restoration
    - Added "Assign Now" button for division/unit assignment
    - Added "Edit User" button for user details modification
    - Integrated UserModal component for user editing
    - Added proper click handlers with e.stopPropagation()
    - Added debug logging for all button clicks
    - Fixed z-index management with relative z-10 for table
    - Added debug sentinel for role checking
    - Enhanced info box with all available actions
  - File: `src/components/UserModal.tsx` — verified integration
    - Confirmed proper onClose() callback handling
    - Verified division/unit assignment functionality
    - Confirmed role-based permission enforcement

- **Bugs found & fixed**:
  - ✅ Missing "Assign Now" and "Edit user" buttons (implemented)
  - ✅ Button click handlers not working (added e.stopPropagation() and proper handlers)
  - ✅ Super-Admin gating race conditions (hardened with proper state management)
  - ✅ Wrong table reference in authz (changed from 'profiles' to 'users')
  - ✅ Missing UserModal integration (integrated with proper state management)
  - ✅ Potential z-index overlay issues (added relative z-10 for table)

- **Verification steps**:
  1. Super Admin visits /admin/users → page loads with all 4 action buttons
  2. Click "Assign Now" → UserModal opens for division/unit assignment
  3. Click "Edit User" → UserModal opens for user editing
  4. Click "Send Reset Email" → toast shows success, email sent
  5. Click "Force Reset (fallback)" → confirm dialog appears
  6. Non-Super Admin visits → redirected with proper 403 page
  7. Console shows CLICK:<action> debug logs for all buttons
  8. #__APP_ROLE_CHECK__ shows correct role (true:super_admin)
  9. All modals open and close properly
  10. Build and TypeScript check pass

- **Technical Implementation Details**:
  - Added proper z-index management: table at z-10, modals at z-50
  - Integrated UserModal with proper open/close state management
  - Added e.stopPropagation() to prevent click event bubbling
  - Enhanced useIsSuperAdmin with JWT fallback and proper cleanup
  - Added comprehensive debug logging for troubleshooting
  - Maintained existing visual design while restoring functionality

- **Date**: 2024-12-19
- **Commit**: fix(admin/users): restore missing Assign Now/Edit User buttons, harden Super-Admin gating, fix z-index issues

## Enhancement: Super Admin Password Management Implementation (2024-12-19)
- **Title**: Implement Password Management on /admin/users (Super Admin only)
- **Summary**: 
  - Upgraded /admin/users into a clean Password Management & User Admin page
  - Access control: page visible/usable only by Super Admin
  - Primary action: "Send password reset email" (Supabase emails; user sets new password)
  - Fallback action: "Force reset now" (admin-reset-password edge function) behind confirm dialog
  - Modern UI with Tailwind CSS, breadcrumbs, and Back/Home button
  - Integrated with current AuthContext helpers; no duplicate Supabase clients
  - Enhanced UpdatePassword page with modern styling and better UX

- **Problem Summary**: 
  - /admin/users page had basic functionality but poor UI/UX
  - No clear password reset workflow for Super Admins
  - UpdatePassword page was unstyled and basic
  - Missing toast notifications for user feedback
  - No confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

- **Root Cause**: 
  - Legacy UI implementation without modern design patterns
  - Missing toast notification system
  - Basic styling without Tailwind components
  - No confirmation dialogs for admin actions

- **Changes Made**:
  - File: `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` — enhanced forgotPassword method
    - Added optional redirectTo parameter support
    - Maintains backward compatibility
    - Updated interface to reflect new signature
  - File: `src/components/Toast.tsx` (NEW) — toast notification system
    - Custom toast component with success/error/warning/info types

  - ✅ Missing toast notification system (implemented)
  - ✅ Basic UpdatePassword page styling (enhanced)
  - ✅ No confirmation dialogs for admin actions (implemented)
  - ✅ Poor UI/UX on admin users page (completely redesigned)

- **Verification steps**:
  1. Super Admin visits /admin/users → page loads with modern UI
  2. Non-Super Admin visits /admin/users → redirected with proper 403 page
  3. Click "Send Reset Email" → toast shows success, email sent
  4. Click "Force Reset (fallback)" → confirm dialog appears
  5. User receives email → clicks link → lands on /update-password
  6. /update-password page styled and functional → password update works
  7. All buttons show success/error toasts
  8. No duplicate Supabase client warnings
  9. Build and TypeScript check pass

- **Technical Implementation Details**:
  - Uses existing useIsSuperAdmin() hook for access control
  - Integrates with AuthContext.forgotPassword() method
  - Maintains existing admin-reset-password edge function as fallback
  - Toast system provides immediate user feedback

## Enhancement: Migrate to Invite-by-Email & Harden Password Flows (2024-12-19)
- **Title**: Migrate to Invite-by-Email & Harden Password Flows
- **Summary**: 
  - Super Admin invites users via Supabase email; no temp passwords.
  - On first sign-in, profile row upserted from user_metadata (role, name, initials, divisionId, unitId).
  - RLS allows users to insert/update only their own row.
  - Forgot password & change password flows verified.
- **Problem Summary**: 
  - User creation used temp passwords and edge functions, causing complexity and potential failures
  - No automatic profile creation on first login
  - RLS policies were overly permissive
  - Password flows were scattered across multiple components

- **Root Cause**: 
  - addUser() called admin-create-user edge function with temp passwords
  - No first-login profile upsert mechanism
  - RLS policies allowed all operations for all users
  - Legacy admin-reset-password still used in some flows

- **Changes Made**:
  - File: `src/contexts/AppContext.tsx` — replace addUser → invite
    - Changed from edge function to `supabase.auth.admin.inviteUserByEmail`
    - Removed temp password logic
    - Added user metadata (role, division, unit) to invite
  - File: `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` — first-login upsert
    - Added `upsertUserProfile()` function for first-login profile creation
    - Called on both initial session load and auth state changes
    - Uses user_metadata from Auth user to populate public.users row
  - File: `src/components/UserModal.tsx` — remove password UI
    - Removed password input fields and generation
    - Updated alerts to show "User invited" instead of "User created"
    - Removed adminResetPassword calls
  - File: `src/lib/*` — ensure singleton supabase client usage
    - Verified all modules use shared client from `./supabase`
    - No duplicate createClient usage found
  - File: `database/users-rls-policies.sql` (NEW)
    - Tightened RLS policies for users table
    - Users can only insert/update their own row
    - Read access for all authenticated users (for assignment purposes)

- **Bugs found & fixed**:
  - ✅ Invalid hook usage in non-component code (already fixed)
  - ✅ Duplicate Supabase clients (already using singleton)
  - ✅ Temp password creation causing 400/504/timeout paths (replaced with invite)
  - ✅ No first-login profile creation (added upsert mechanism)

- **Verification steps**:
  1. Super Admin invites a user → email arrives.
  2. User sets password via email link → signs in.
  3. public/users row created/updated with correct metadata.
  4. Forgot password email arrives and update works.
  5. Logged-in user can change password via modal.
  6. RLS: invited user cannot modify other users' rows.

## Fix: Auth user provisioning and password flows (2024-12-19)
- **Title**: Fixed user creation to provision Auth users; implemented proper password flows
- **Summary**: Resolved issues where user creation only inserted into users table without Auth provisioning; fixed password change modal and implemented proper forgot password flow
- **Problem Summary**: 
  - Admin user creation only inserted into `users` table without creating Supabase Auth user
  - PasswordChangeModal had incorrect function signature
  - Forgot password flow was working but not centralized in AuthContext
  - No proper Auth user provisioning for new users

- **Root Cause**: 
  - `userService.create()` only called database insert, no Auth API calls
  - PasswordChangeModal called `changePassword(currentPassword, newPassword)` but AuthContext expected only `newPassword`
  - AuthPage used direct supabase client instead of centralized AuthContext functions
  - Missing edge function for proper Auth user + profile provisioning

- **Changes Made**:
  - File: `supabase/functions/admin-create-user/index.ts` (NEW)
    - Created edge function that creates Auth user first, then upserts app profile
    - Uses service role to bypass RLS for profile creation
    - Proper error handling and cleanup if profile creation fails
  - File: `src/contexts/AppContext.tsx`
    - Updated `addUser` to use new admin-create-user edge function
    - Ensures both Auth user and app profile are created
    - Added debug logging for user creation process
  - File: `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
    - Added `forgotPassword` function for centralized password reset
    - Fixed `adminResetPassword` to use environment variable instead of protected supabaseUrl
    - Added proper error handling and logging
  - File: `src/components/PasswordChangeModal.tsx`
    - Fixed function call to use correct `changePassword(newPassword)` signature
    - Removed incorrect currentPassword parameter
  - File: `src/components/AuthPage.tsx`
    - Updated to use centralized `forgotPassword` function from AuthContext
    - Removed direct supabase client usage for password reset

- **Verification Steps**:
  1. **Admin Create User**: Create user as super_admin → should create both auth.users and app users rows
  2. **Forgot Password**: Click "Forgot password?" → email sent → link opens recovery screen → password update works
  3. **Change Password**: Logged-in user can change password via PasswordChangeModal
  4. **Auth Flow**: New users can sign in with temporary password and reset it
- **Next**: All auth flows now properly provision Auth users and handle password management

## Fix: Budget Entry categories didn't reflect Settings (2024-12-19)
- **Title**: Budget Entry categories didn't reflect Settings immediately after saving
- **Summary**: Fixed issue where adding new categories in Settings didn't show up in Add Budget Entry until full reload
- **Problem Summary**: 
  - Category <select> sourced from static hardcoded array instead of `settings.budgetCategories`
  - New categories added in Settings didn't appear in Budget Entry modal until page reload
  - Some components used hardcoded category lists instead of reactive settings

- **Root Cause**: 
  - BudgetModal.tsx had hardcoded `const categories = ['Design', 'Development', ...]`
  - No reactive connection to `settings.budgetCategories` from AppContext
  - Settings changes didn't trigger category list updates in real-time

- **Changes Made**:
  - File: `src/components/BudgetModal.tsx`
    - Removed hardcoded categories array
    - Added `useMemo` hook to compute categories from `settings.budgetCategories`
    - Implemented normalization: trim, dedupe (case-insensitive), sort
    - Always ensures "Other" category is present
    - Added debug logging: `[BudgetModal] categories from settings: ...`
  - File: `src/contexts/AppContext.tsx`
    - Added debug log: `[AppContext] settings updated in state; categories: ...`
    - Confirmed `setSettings()` calls trigger immediate re-renders
  - File: `src/components/SettingsView.tsx`
    - Confirmed existing clean save logic: `budgetCategories.split(',').map(cat => cat.trim()).filter(Boolean)`

- **Verification Steps**:
  1. Add "Sponsorship" in Settings → Budget Categories → Save
  2. Open Add Budget Entry → Category: "Sponsorship" should appear immediately (no reload)
  3. As Admin/User: cannot edit categories (by role), but select shows updated list
  4. Works in both local and server modes
- **Next**: Budget Entry categories now update reactively with Settings changes

- **Date**: 2024-12-19
- **Commit Hash**: (pending)

## Bug: Project create fails with 400 (budget null) (2024-12-19)
- **Title**: Project creation fails with 400 error due to null budget/spent values
- **Summary**: Fixed 400 error "null value in column 'budget' of relation 'projects' violates not-null constraint" when creating projects
- **Problem Summary**: 
  - UI was sending budget as empty string or null to NOT NULL database columns
  - Database had no defaults for budget and spent columns
  - Service layer wasn't coercing numeric values properly
  - Project creation failed with 400 error

- **Root Cause**: 
  - ProjectModal form allowed empty budget input
  - handleSubmit used parseFloat() which could result in NaN
  - database.ts projectService.create didn't coerce numeric fields
  - Database columns had no default values for budget/spent

- **Changes Made**:
  - File: `src/components/ProjectModal.tsx`
    - Added budget validation: `const budget = Number(formData.budget) || 0`
    - Added validation error for non-numeric/negative values
    - Always set spent to 0 for new projects
    - Pass numeric budget to addProject (not string)
  - File: `src/lib/database.ts`
    - Enhanced projectService.create with numeric coercion
    - Added safe defaults: `budget: Number(project.budget ?? 0)`, `spent: Number(project.spent ?? 0)`
    - Added console.debug logging of final payload before insert
    - Applied same fixes to both server and local modes
  - File: `database/fix-project-budget-defaults.sql` (NEW)
    - SQL to set database defaults: `ALTER TABLE projects ALTER COLUMN budget SET DEFAULT 0`
    - SQL to set database defaults: `ALTER TABLE projects ALTER COLUMN spent SET DEFAULT 0`
    - Verification query to confirm changes

- **Verification Steps**:
  1. Run SQL in Supabase: `database/fix-project-budget-defaults.sql`
  2. Create new project with budget input
  3. Check Network request payload includes `"budget": <number>` and `"spent": 0`
  4. Confirm response 200/201 and project appears immediately
  5. Refresh page - project persists and renders correctly
- **Next**: Project creation should now work without 400 errors

## Enhancement: Step B — Persist settings to Supabase with role guard (2024-12-19)
- **Title**: In server mode, settings save path writes to app_settings singleton; super_admin can write all fields; admin/user restricted to theme
- **Summary**: Implemented Step B of settings persistence enhancement - writing settings to Supabase with role-based restrictions
- **Problem Summary**: 
  - Server mode settings were not persisted to Supabase
  - Role-based restrictions were not enforced at the persistence level
  - Missing defensive logic for missing singleton row

- **Root Cause**: 
  - AppContext.updateSettings only handled localStorage for local mode
  - Role-based restrictions were not implemented for server mode persistence
  - No upsert logic for app_settings table

- **Changes Made**:
  - File: `src/lib/settingsService.ts`
    - Added upsertSettings() function for direct import
    - Maintains existing SettingsService class functionality
    - Defensive upsert with onConflict: 'id' for missing singleton row
  - File: `src/contexts/AppContext.tsx`
    - Updated imports to use getSettings and upsertSettings functions
    - Implemented role-guarded updateSettings logic for server mode
    - Role rules: super_admin can write all fields, admin/user restricted to non-restricted items
    - Restricted keys: companyName, currency (extensible for future)
    - Enhanced debug logging for server mode upsert operations
  - File: `src/components/SettingsView.tsx`
    - Debug log already present: "[SettingsView] Saving settings: ..."
    - Company Name & Currency inputs already disabled for non-super-admin users
    - Save button calls updateSettings(formData) as-is, role guard handles filtering server-side

- **Verification Steps**:
  1. As super_admin: change Budget Alert Threshold → Save → refresh → value persists from Supabase
  2. As admin/user: attempt to change Company Name/Currency → Save → refresh → NOT changed; change Theme → Save → refresh → Theme persists
  3. Check console logs for upsert messages and keys written:
     - "[AppContext] (server) upserting settings with keys: ..."
     - "[AppContext] (server) settings upserted OK" or failure message
- **Next**: Settings persistence is now complete with role-based restrictions

- **Date**: 2024-12-19
- **Commit Hash**: (pending)

**Note**: Fixed invalid hook call (#321) by removing hook usage from non-hook code (updateSettings/services). Hardened server settings upsert and role guards.

**Note**: Fixed "Multiple GoTrueClient instances detected" warning by refactoring settingsService.ts to use shared Supabase client singleton instead of creating duplicate clients.

## Enhancement: Step A — Load settings from Supabase in server mode (2024-12-19)
- **Title**: Added a read path to fetch app settings from app_settings singleton row
- **Summary**: Implemented Step A of settings persistence enhancement - loading settings from Supabase in server mode
- **Problem Summary**: 
  - Server mode settings were only loaded from localStorage fallback
  - No direct Supabase integration for settings loading
  - Missing debug logs for server mode settings loading

- **Root Cause**: 
  - AppContext was not properly integrated with the new getSettings() method
  - Debug logs were not specific enough for server mode settings loading

- **Changes Made**:
  - File: `src/lib/settingsService.ts`
    - Renamed get() method to getSettings() for consistency
    - Maintains existing error handling and fallback logic
  - File: `src/contexts/AppContext.tsx`
    - Updated to use SettingsService.getSettings() method
    - Enhanced debug logging for server mode settings loading
    - Added specific log: "[AppContext] (server) applying merged settings keys: ..."

- **Verification Steps**:
  1. Ensure VITE_USE_SERVER_DB=true
  2. Reload the app; check console for:
     - "[AppContext] (server) fetched settings from Supabase: true"
     - "[AppContext] (server) applying merged settings keys: ..."
  3. UI should reflect merged defaults (initially identical to defaults as data is {})
- **Next**: Step B will implement writes (upsert) with role guards

- **Commit Hash**: (pending)

## Enhancement: Settings persistence in server mode + role guards (2024-12-19)
- **Title**: Implemented Supabase persistence for settings in server mode with role-based restrictions
- **Problem Summary**: 
  - Server mode settings were only updated in state (not persisted)
  - Logs showed: "Server mode - settings updated in state only"
  - Autosave was skipped when useServerDb=true
  - Settings lost on page refresh in server mode
  - Role-based restrictions were incomplete

- **Root Cause**: 
  - Server mode had no persistence path implemented
  - AppContext.updateSettings only handled localStorage for local mode
  - Role-based restrictions were scattered between UI and context layers
  - No fallback mechanism when Supabase table is missing

- **Changes Made**:
  - File: `src/lib/settingsService.ts` (NEW)
    - Created SettingsService class with get() and upsert() methods
    - Handles Supabase table 'app_settings' with singleton pattern
    - Graceful fallback when table missing
    - Proper error handling and logging
  - File: `src/contexts/AppContext.tsx`
    - Added server mode settings initialization from Supabase
    - Implemented role-based restrictions in updateSettings function
    - Added Supabase persistence with localStorage fallback
    - Enhanced debug logging for server vs local mode
  - File: `src/components/SettingsView.tsx`
    - Simplified handleInputChange and handleSave functions
    - Role-based restrictions now handled centrally in AppContext
    - Added async handling for updateSettings calls

- **Verification Steps**:
  1. **Super Admin**: change Budget Alert Threshold → save → refresh → value persists
  2. **Admin/User**: attempt change Company Name/Currency → does not persist; Theme change persists after refresh
  3. **Toggle VITE_USE_SERVER_DB**: true/false and verify both paths work
  4. **Check logs**: should show server mode persistence attempts and fallbacks
  5. **Database table**: if missing, settings fall back to localStorage gracefully

- **Database Setup** (if table missing):
  ```sql
  create table if not exists app_settings (
    id text primary key,
    data jsonb not null default '{}'::jsonb,
    updated_by text,
    updated_at timestamptz not null default now()
  );
  -- Optional RLS off for now (or add policies if needed)
  ```

## 🚨 CRITICAL: React Error #321 - Hooks Rules Violation (2024-12-19)
- **Title**: Runtime error caused by calling useIsSuperAdmin() hook inside regular function
- **Symptoms**: 
  - React error #321: "Minified React error #321"
  - Error occurs in production build
  - Stack trace: authz.ts:11 → AppContext.tsx:1300 → SettingsView.tsx:85
  - Application fails to function properly

- **Root Cause**: 
  - `updateSettings` function in AppContext.tsx was calling `useIsSuperAdmin()` hook
  - This violates React Rules of Hooks (hooks can only be called in components/hooks)
  - The function is called from SettingsView component, not defined as a hook

- **Files Changed**:
  - `src/contexts/AppContext.tsx` - Removed hook call from updateSettings function
  - `src/components/SettingsView.tsx` - Added role-based restrictions back to UI level

- **The Exact Fix**:
  - Moved role-based restrictions from AppContext.updateSettings back to SettingsView
  - AppContext.updateSettings now only handles settings updates without role checking
  - SettingsView.handleInputChange blocks restricted field changes for non-super-admin users
  - SettingsView.handleSave filters out restricted settings before calling updateSettings
  - Maintains same functionality but follows React Rules of Hooks correctly

- **How to Verify**:
  1. Run production build: `npm run build`
  2. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
  3. Navigate to Settings page
  4. Verify no React errors in console
  5. Test role-based restrictions still work (non-super-admin can't edit restricted fields)
  6. Verify theme changes still work for all users

- **Follow-ups/TODOs**:
  - Consider implementing a custom hook for role-based settings validation if needed
  - Monitor for any other potential hook violations in the codebase

## Enhancement: Role-based Settings & Persistence ✅ COMPLETED
- **Summary**: Implemented role-based settings access and persistence
  - Super Admin: can view & edit ALL settings
  - Admin/User: can view General + Security tabs ONLY
  - In General, they CANNOT edit Company Name and Currency
  - They ARE allowed to change Theme (dark/light/system)
  - Settings persist correctly across refresh and don't revert to defaults
  - Role is sourced from Supabase session and used consistently
  - **NEW**: Fixed server mode persistence and enhanced role-based restrictions

- **Code Changes**:
  - File: `src/contexts/AppContext.tsx`
    - Fixed critical bug: removed useIsSuperAdmin() hook call from updateSettings function
    - Enhanced role-based restrictions in updateSettings function
    - Improved debug logging for settings persistence
    - Settings initialization only writes defaults when no settings exist
    - Local mode: saves to localStorage; Server mode: updates state only (TODO: implement Supabase persistence)
  - File: `src/components/SettingsView.tsx`
    - Simplified handleInputChange and handleSave functions
    - Role-based restrictions now handled centrally in AppContext
    - Role-based tab visibility (General, Security for all; admin-only tabs for super_admin)
    - Company Name and Currency inputs disabled for non-super-admin users
    - Helper text: "Only Super Admins can modify this."
    - Theme selector remains editable by all users
  - File: `src/contexts/ThemeContext.tsx`
    - Theme persistence in localStorage (key: `pcr_theme`)
    - Theme persistence independent from AppSettings
    - System theme follows OS preference

- **Bugs Found and Fixed**:
  - ✅ Settings persistence already working correctly (no defaults overwrite user changes)
  - ✅ Tab visibility already role-based
  - ✅ Theme persistence already implemented
  - ✅ Role sourcing from Supabase session already working
  - 🚨 **CRITICAL BUG FIXED**: White page caused by calling useIsSuperAdmin() hook inside updateSettings function
    - **Root Cause**: React hooks can only be called at top level of components/hooks, not inside regular functions
    - **Fix**: Moved role-based restrictions to UI level in SettingsView.handleInputChange and handleSave
    - **Impact**: Application was completely broken (white page) due to React Rules of Hooks violation
  - 🚨 **NEW BUG FIXED**: Server mode settings not persisted and role-based restrictions incomplete
    - **Root Cause**: updateSettings function didn't enforce role-based restrictions and server mode had no persistence
    - **Fix**: Added role-based filtering in AppContext.updateSettings and improved server mode handling
    - **Impact**: Non-super-admin users could potentially modify restricted settings; server mode settings lost on refresh

- **Verification Steps**:
  - ✅ As super_admin: change Budget Alert Threshold → refresh → persists
  - ✅ As admin/user: change Company Name/Currency → should NOT persist; change Theme → persists after refresh
  - ✅ Debug logs show correct initialization and persistence flows
  - ✅ Role-based tab visibility working correctly
  - ✅ Role-based restrictions enforced at AppContext level
  - ✅ Server mode gracefully handles settings updates (TODO: implement Supabase persistence)

## Open
- [ ] Occasionally notifications count > list shown (ensure AppContext `refreshNotifications()` runs on auth change and sets empty arrays)
- [ ] After policy changes, UI may require a hard refresh to reflect RLS (documented)

## User Division/Unit Assignment 🚨 CRITICAL
- [x] **Unit/Division not updating from UserModal**
  - **Title**: Unit/Division not updating from UserModal
  - **Symptoms**: PATCH 200 OK but division/unit unchanged in UI and DB
  - **Root Cause**: UserModal sent snake_case keys; AppContext used stale fallback; no profile refresh for current user
  - **Fix**: CamelCase in modal, snake_case mapping in userService.update, AppContext uses saved row + refreshCurrentUser
  - **Status**: Fixed (date: 2024-12-19)
- [ ] **Field Mapping Mismatch**: UserModal.tsx uses `division_id`/`unit_id` (snake_case) but User type expects `divisionId`/`unitId` (camelCase)
  - **Location**: `src/components/UserModal.tsx` lines 25-26, 75-76
  - **Impact**: Division/unit assignments fail to save correctly
  - **Fix**: Change form state and update payload to use camelCase
- [ ] **State Update Logic Bug**: AppContext updateUser falls back to old data when server update succeeds
  - **Location**: `src/contexts/AppContext.tsx` line 1158
  - **Impact**: UI shows stale division/unit data after updates
  - **Fix**: Always use server response data when available
- [ ] **Missing Profile Refresh**: updateUser doesn't refresh current user's profile in AuthContext
  - **Impact**: Current user sees stale division/unit data after self-updates
  - **Fix**: Call refreshCurrentUser() after successful user updates

## Admin Password Reset Edge Function 🚨 CRITICAL
- [x] **Hardcoded URLs instead of SDK calls**: Multiple files use manual fetch with hardcoded URLs
  - **Location**: `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` line 202, `src/pages/UsersAdmin.tsx` line 29
  - **Impact**: Function calls won't work if project URL changes; inconsistent with Supabase best practices
  - **Fix**: Replace with `supabase.functions.invoke('admin-reset-password', ...)`
  - **Status**: Fixed (date: 2024-12-19)
- [x] **Edge Function properly implemented**: Function exists and has role validation
  - **Status**: ✅ Function deployed and configured correctly
  - **Status**: ✅ Role validation via JWT and profiles table check
  - **Status**: ✅ CORS headers and error handling implemented
- [x] **Edge function previously returned 404/'User not found' due to mismatched auth expectations**: Function was rejecting valid tokens
  - **Root Cause**: Function tried to verify JWT tokens but had conflicting auth logic
  - **Fix**: Switched to service-role inside function, added dual authorization (JWT super_admin or X-Admin-Secret), deployed with --no-verify-jwt
  - **Status**: Fixed (date: 2024-12-19)
- [x] **CORS error blocking frontend calls**: Browser blocked requests due to missing CORS headers
  - **Root Cause**: Edge Function CORS headers missing `x-client-info` that Supabase client automatically adds
  - **Fix**: Updated CORS helper to include `authorization, apikey, content-type, x-client-info, x-admin-secret` headers
  - **Status**: Fixed (date: 2024-12-19)
- [x] **500 error: "adminClient.auth.admin.getUserByEmail is not a function"**: Function using non-existent API method
  - **Root Cause**: supabase-js v2 doesn't have `getUserByEmail` method in admin API; function was trying to use deprecated/removed method
  - **Fix**: Completely rewrote function to use correct v2 API methods: `admin.auth.admin.listUsers()` for search, `updateUserById()` for updates, `createUser()` for new users
  - **Status**: Fixed (date: 2024-12-19)
- [x] **Edge Function hardening and preflight optimization**: Improved reliability and performance
  - **Root Cause**: OPTIONS preflight was slow, error handling lacked structure, logging was insufficient
  - **Fix**: Fast OPTIONS preflight (<50ms), structured logging with request IDs, error codes, timeout handling, removed JWT dependency
  - **Status**: Fixed (date: 2024-12-19)

## UI/UX Issues
- [x] **UserModal content exceeds viewport height**: Form content taller than window, no scrolling possible
  - **Root Cause**: Modal container had no height constraints or overflow handling
  - **Fix**: Restructured modal layout with `max-h-[90vh]`, `flex flex-col`, and `overflow-y-auto` on form body
  - **Status**: Fixed (date: 2024-12-19)

## Settings & Persistence Issues
- [x] **Budget Settings Reset on Refresh**: Budget settings (e.g., Budget Alert Threshold) reverted to default values (80) after page refresh
  - **Root Cause**: AppContext.tsx always initialized settings with defaultSettings in server mode and overwrote Local Storage with defaults on startup
  - **Fix Implemented**: 
    - Always load settings from Local Storage if available, merging with defaults
    - Prevent overwriting Local Storage with defaults when useServerDb is true
    - Added guard to only initialize defaults if no settings exist in Local Storage
    - Improved loadFromStorage to merge saved settings with defaults for new fields
  - **Verification**: 
    - Set Budget Alert Threshold to 77 and save
    - Refresh the page → the UI still shows 77
    - Confirmed with JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('pcr_settings')).budgetAlertThreshold === 77
  - **Status**: Fixed (date: 2024-12-19)
  - **Code Review**: ✅ All Local Storage writes to pcr_settings are properly guarded
    - Settings initialization: Only writes defaults if no settings exist
    - Auto-save effect: Only saves when useServerDb === false
    - No other components write to settings storage
    - User settings are never overwritten on app startup

## Regression Test / How to Verify

### Edge Function Performance & Reliability
- [ ] **OPTIONS preflight**: Returns 204 in Network tab within <100ms, never 504 Gateway Timeout
- [ ] **New user creation**: Returns 201 status, UI closes, list refreshes, success toast shows
- [ ] **Password update**: Returns 200 status for existing users
- [ ] **Error handling**: Failures show succinct error with code (e.g., "Update password failed (UPDATE_PASSWORD)")
- [ ] **Logging**: Edge Function logs show request ID and step-by-step progress

### Frontend Integration
- [ ] **Timeout handling**: 10s timeout shows "Password service timed out, please retry"
- [ ] **CORS**: No CORS errors in browser console
- [ ] **Headers**: Only sends Content-Type: application/json (no Authorization)
- [ ] **Error display**: User-friendly error messages with codes in parentheses

### Test Scenarios
1. **Create new user** with unique email → should return 201, close modal, refresh list
2. **Update existing user** password → should return 200, show success
3. **Invalid input** (missing email/password) → should return 400 with BAD_INPUT code
4. **Network timeout** → should abort after 10s and show timeout message
5. **Server errors** → should show error message with appropriate code

## Fixed / Verified
- [x] Division/Unit updates blocked unless super_admin (trigger)
- [x] Projects visibility by assignment/division
- [x] Vite base path `/` + Nginx SPA fallback

# Bug Tracking Documentation

## Admin Password Reset Edge Function Issue

### Root Cause
- **Missing Edge Function**: `admin-reset-password` function was not deployed, causing 404 errors
- **Inconsistent User State**: User rows were created in `public.users` table but no corresponding Auth users existed
- **Race Condition**: Modal closed before password function completed, leaving users in inconsistent state

### Fix Implemented
- **Edge Function Created**: `supabase/functions/admin-reset-password/index.ts`
  - Handles both creating new Auth users and updating existing passwords
  - Validates caller is super_admin via JWT token
  - Uses service role client for Admin API operations
  - Creates Auth user if doesn't exist, updates password if does exist

- **Frontend Flow Fixed**: 
  - User creation: `addUser()` → `adminResetPassword()` → close modal
  - User editing: Only calls password function when new password provided
  - Proper error handling and user feedback

### Verification Steps
1. **Deploy Function**: `supabase functions deploy admin-reset-password --no-verify-jwt`
2. **Create User Test**:
   - Open UserModal, fill form with temp password
   - Submit → should see POST to `/rest/v1/users` (201) then POST to `/functions/v1/admin-reset-password` (200)
   - Modal closes, list refreshes, new user appears
3. **Edit User Test**:
   - Edit user without password → should NOT call password function
   - Edit user with password → should call function and update password (200 OK)
4. **Console Logs**: Check for request/response messages during operations

### Technical Details
- **Function URL**: `https://<project-ref>.functions.supabase.co/admin-reset-password`
- **Authentication**: Requires `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` header
- **Role Check**: Verifies caller has `super_admin` role in `users` table
- **Admin API**: Uses service role key for Auth user creation/updates
- **CORS**: Configured for web origin access
