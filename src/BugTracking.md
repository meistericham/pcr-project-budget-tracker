## Issue: Google Sheets Integration Fails

- **Symptom:** The "Connect to Google Sheets" button fails, preventing users from authorizing the application and syncing data.
- **Root Cause:** The failure is likely due to an OAuth 2.0 misconfiguration in the Google Cloud Platform console, not a code error. The application code correctly uses a dynamic redirect URI (`window.location.origin + '/auth/callback/google'`) and specifies the necessary scopes (`spreadsheets`, `drive.file`).

### Required Configuration

For the integration to work across different environments, the following settings must be configured in the **Google Cloud Platform OAuth 2.0 Client ID** settings:

1.  **Authorized JavaScript Origins**:
    - `http://localhost:3000`
    - `https://pcrtracker.meistericham.com`

2.  **Authorized Redirect URIs**:
    - `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback/google`
    - `https://pcrtracker.meistericham.com/auth/callback/google`

3.  **Consent Screen**:
    - If the consent screen is in "Testing" mode, the user's Google account must be added to the list of test users.

### Code-Level Actions

- Added robust `console.error` logging to the `handleConnect` and `handleExport` functions in `src/components/GoogleSheetsIntegration.tsx` to capture any API-level errors during the OAuth flow or subsequent API calls.
- No changes to scopes or redirect URIs were needed as they were already correctly implemented.
